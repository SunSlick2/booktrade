        "      * Are you running it directly from an Anaconda Prompt/terminal?\n",
        "      * Are you double-clicking the `.py` file? (This often just flashes a window and closes if there's an error.)\n",
        "      * Are you running it from an IDE (like VS Code, PyCharm, or Spyder)?\n",
        "      * Are you using IDLE's \"Run Module\" (F5)?\n",

        "  * **Crucial Test: Run from a Controlled Environment:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    1.  **Open a fresh Anaconda Prompt** (or a regular Command Prompt if you don't use Anaconda for this project).\n",
        "    2.  **Activate your environment** (if using one): `conda activate your_easyocr_env`\n",
        "    3.  **Navigate to the exact directory** where your `DateOCR_TesseractFailed.py` (or whatever you've named the latest version) is located:\n",
        "        `cd C:\\Users\\abc\\OneDrive\\Documents\\Tools\\PythonScripts`\n",
        "    4.  **Execute the script directly:**\n",
        "        `python DateOCR_TesseractFailed.py` (replace with your actual filename)\n",
        "\n",
        "    **What to look for:**\n",
        "\n",
        "      * **Does *anything* print to this command prompt window?** Even error messages will appear here.\n",
        "      * **Does the `extracted_date_easyocr.txt` file appear** in `C:\\Users\\abc\\OneDrive\\Documents\\Tools\\PythonScripts`?\n",
        "      * **Does `captured_date_region_debug.png` appear** in the same directory?\n",
        "\n",
        "    **If you still get no output and no files when running like this, it points to a very early crash.**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 2: Debugging Immediate Crashes\n",
        "\n",
        "If the script crashes instantly, it's usually due to:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Syntax Errors:** A typo that prevents Python from even parsing the file.\n",
        "  * **Missing Core Imports:** A fundamental library like `mss` or `PIL` isn't installed or is corrupted.\n",
        "  * **Incorrect `os.environ` Placement:** Though less likely to cause a *complete* crash, if the `os.environ` line is misplaced or `os` isn't imported first, it could be an issue.\n",
